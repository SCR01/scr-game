# 🚀 Usage

Once the SCR Gaming app is running locally (`npm run dev`), you can explore its smooth scroll animations and component-based layout.

---

## 🧭 Navigating the App

The application is a **single-page frontend** with multiple scrollable sections:

- **Hero Section** – Bold title and visual introduction with animations.
- **About/Game Section** – Describes the game idea or concept.
- **Animated Sections** – Text and image elements that animate as you scroll.
- **Footer** – Contact links and social media icons.

> All scroll-triggered animations are powered by GSAP for performance and precision.

## 🖱️ User Interaction

- **Scroll Down** to reveal each section with a smooth entrance effect.
- **Hover Effects** on icons or buttons (if present).
- The layout is **fully responsive**, so you can also explore on mobile devices or tablets.

---

## 🎯 Developer Usage Tips

- Open browser dev tools to inspect component structure (`React DevTools` recommended).
- Modify any section via the `src/components/` or `src/pages/` folders.
- Customize animations inside `src/animations` or directly within relevant components.
